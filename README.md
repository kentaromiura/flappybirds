Flappy Birds
============

This project is our entry in the [Birdy Flap Jam (Jammy Flap Flap)](http://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-Game-Developers/events/166271502/?a=gs1.1_l) 6 hours code jam

In order to have an _almost_ full feature game, we decide to use the http://freeflappybird.org/ assets, with the plan of replacing them with something designed by us when everything was done if we had the time to do it, unfortunately this wasn't the case


Install:

```
npm install
```

Run:
```
./run.sh
```
